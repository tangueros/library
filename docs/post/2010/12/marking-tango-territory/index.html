<h2>transcript</h2>

<p>hi you must be new here yes I am you
must be the DJ that&#39;s right I am the DJ
but I am also a tango teacher
choreographer performer and coordinator
of everything to do with tango in this
city oh that&#39;s great I think so too
most of the people in this city had
learned tango from me is that so yes
even some of the Argentinian teachers
teaching in this town learned their
first steps from me but of course they
would not admit this today that&#39;s very
impressive of course it is I learned
from the very best nivara ver Ron solace
copays balmaceda they are all personal
friends of mine when I come to Buenos
Aires they invite me to stay with them
every time I help them spread their
dance in this country they&#39;re very
grateful I am sure they are of course as
a beginner you have not heard these
names before but they are some of the
greatest masters of the dance actually I
have I have been dancing for 6 years 6
years it&#39;s not still a beginner I saw
the original tango Broadway show you
weren&#39;t even born then not everything in
tango is about how much time you spend
there is quality and there is quantity
nothing beats experience my friend
because of me people beyond the Iron
Curtain can now dance tango all because
of your generosity I brought them tango
music they had nothing you know and I
thought poor people they should have
some music to dance to
you&#39;re a true tango philanthropist and
you my friend do you like my music I
only play the best you know not like the
others well I was actually wondering
whether I could make a wish of course my
friend my tango collection is vast what
would you like
would you have some Karla with Paran
coming up on your playlist Oh
or maybe some donato Oh or maybe some
tan jewelry Oh what about Gary Enzo
darienne&#39;s oh the devil no way
Gary answer was techno music from the
1930s Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam
are you kidding me but you have been
playing Piazzolla for the last hour
Piazzolla was a genius and so was Gardel
my selection is based on these two
masters you will come to appreciate
their music sometime but as a beginner
you are not expected to know about this
so I cannot request anything of course
my friend you can it just needs to be
good music proper tango music you know
like the Azula
or maybe Buble a C because I am in a
good mood today but maybe a good beat
will give dancers more energy and
structure the dancers look like
jellyfish in an aquarium they float
aimlessly through the room without any
purpose and direction my friend I see
that you have a warped perception of
tango this is not ballroom dancing you
don&#39;t learn sequences tango is
improvisation freedom of expression of
course but these people here can&#39;t even
walk how are they supposed to express
themselves to Piazzolla are you saying
that my students cannot dance tango all
I&#39;m saying is that a little beat could
help them with the dancing my friend I
see that we have a long way ahead of us
and teaching you about tango my
beginners classes are Mondays and
Wednesdays from 7 to 8</p>
