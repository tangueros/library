 Janet Carlson's book Quick, Before the Music Stops.

 I really enjoyed Janet Carlson's book Quick, Before the Music Stops. I have tried giving other autobiographical dance memoirs a chance, but they are typically very superficial and saccharine, and they all say the same thing. I found Carlson's book very deep and engaging; I couldn't put it down.

Since Argentine tango has been brought up a few times, I also really enjoyed The Meaning of Tango (Christine Denniston) and Long After Midnight at the Niño Bien (Brian Winter). Denniston explores the history and meaning of the tango, while Winter's book is a memoir and almost reads like a novel.

I find it hard to believe that anyone could be really into ballroom or social dance without also being really into music, so one book that I absolutely loved was The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth Through Music, by Victor Wooten. Reading it from a dancer's perspective, I found it very insightful on the topics of musicality, improvisation, technique, and energy.
